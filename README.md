# MultipleOpps
Custom, dynamic lightning component that can create multiple opportunities at a time. 

Background - a client had a need to create multiple Opportunities at once. I created a custom lightning component that utilizes Field Sets, isUrlAddressable, iteratable components, and the ability to add and delete rows dynamically. 

The Field Set way of picking which fields for input allows an Admin to modify what the component can do.
